## Known Issues / In Development

- [ ] Session-based access control is **commented out** in `settings.php` to allow overlay loading via `fetch()`.
- [ ] Settings overlay currently loads HTML fragment directly; needs AJAX-safe session protection.
- [ ] No backend chat or messaging logic implemented yet.
- [ ] Responsive tweaks for mobile not fully polished.

## Next Steps

- ðŸ”’ Re-enable session checks with AJAX-friendly fallback
- ðŸ“¤ Enable real-time message sending with basic PHP backend
- ðŸ“² Add mobile responsiveness
